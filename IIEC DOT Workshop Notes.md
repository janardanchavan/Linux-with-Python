IIEC RISE ID: RISE2020_71_6_1
## Summary of IIEC DOT - Workshop, Day1, 28-Mar-2020:
- About IIEC DOT initiative
- About COVID19 medical information / domain knowledge is essential to proceed with any project, can be Data Science, Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence.
- 7 topics discussed:
	- Anyone with one of following expertise can apply for project building to identify COVID19 solutions: DRONE / Deep Learning / Mobile App Development / Machine Learning / CNN / 
	- Ventilator - Opensource Ventilator through IOT
	- Tracking Mechanism - App with bluetooth
	- Mobile App with AI
	- Screening process for examine body temperature, extra camera as thermal camera can be used
	- Drone - AI/GPS enabled / object/person detection
	- Good in Robotics knowledge

Definition and relation between - AI vs ML vs DS

Linux (Redhat7) -> Python3 (core) -> ML (Python) -> DL (CNN / Mask-RCNN)

Linux commands : date, calc, gedit, cat, saving file online vf offline as well as using Jupyter IDE.

Developed two computer vision programs for capturing photo and video.
Creating our own application same like chease in Linux.

## Summary of IIEC DOT - Workshop, Day2, 29-Mar-2020:
- How to crop photo using python
- Additional commands: list, nested lists, numpy array, converting list into numpy array, installing packages/libraries,
- In real life, images are exactly same as array
- Array slicing same as image cropping
- more about photo variable, type, value, shape
- cropping images using python
- stickers
- using mobile phone camera - convert phone camera as CCTV/IP Camera

Machine Learning:
- We as human being learn by observing, learn our way, human being are great in vision, pattern of image
- object -> (see by) Camera -> mind/brain -> identity <br/>
  again see -> capture  -> store in brain/main <br/>
  This happen again and again - training brain, continue learning

- Mobile itself is intelligent, pre-trained program, (shows boundry around our face while taking photo)
- Crop image and send to the model to train
- IBPH - face recognization - Algorith (Read the face and set the level)

Python Demo - capturing photo, cropping it, training model using ML based on these photoes

Integrating ML with DevOps - DL-NN-CNN <br/>
(MLOps)

Demo - unlocking use account based on face recognition

Docker Summary and practicals

Demo - ML+DevOps demo with Mask-RCNN, Image Recognition <br/>
Yolo vs Mask-RCNN.
