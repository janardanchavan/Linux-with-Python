1. Linear Regression with python and creating machine learning models and deploying in app/python programming:
We developed a prediction model for HR department for predicting the salary based on existing data using python's sci-kit-lean library.

    Since we used continuous data, we used linear regression for training our model. One can create their prediction by understanding the proper working of the models without having a maths knowledge. It also help us to generate the weight, bias / constant using the developed regression model.
    However, having mathematics knowledge is always good to understand the actual working of the models properly.
    Please refer following Byju's online detailed information on Linear Regression Formula: https://byjus.com/linear-regression-formula/

    Computers are much faster than human brain in processing numbers. Here pythons libraries makes is more faster using ML algorithms.

    Idea: Using regression models we can create different prediction models to achieve many daily required analysis effectively, for example, team productivity, asset tracking, license management, etc.

2. Computer Vision / Image Processing:
    Secondly, we created our own program to take photos and process it e.g. cropping image, editing image colours, changing brightness of the image, overlaying multiple images. This is same as windows camera and Linux's cheese application.
    Human brains are the great computers understanding and learning images/pictures where computer is not so good in understanding images. Here python cv2 library plays a great role to take this to the next level.

    Idea: With this cv2 library and computer's primary, external cameras, we can develop the software to track the people movements at different locations. For example, office receptions or floors, government offices, on road traffic, etc.
